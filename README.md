# excalidraw-desktop
Unofficial desktop client for Excalidraw on Windows, Linux &amp; MacOS. It is just an electron wrapper for the website, I made this because I don't want to use it in a tab.

## Macos Users
If you get the error "Is Damaged and Can’t Be Opened. You Should Move It To The Bin".  
You can run the command:
```bash
xattr -c /Applications/Excalidraw.app
```
This is because I don't have a developer certificate and its not notarized.
